## Exercise I

a)O(n)


b)O(log n)


c)O(n)

## Exercise II

This feels like a trick question. That said, I would start at the bottom floor and drop from each floor. If the dropped egg breaks, I would return the floor I'm on.

The time complexity of this type of function would typically be O(n), however, I would argue that it is constant because whether the building is 5 floors or 50, the egg is still going to break at the same floor.
